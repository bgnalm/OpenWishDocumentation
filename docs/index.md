# Welcome to OpenWish

welcome to the OpenWish documentation page. 

## What's OpenWish?

Are you looking for an idea for your next project?
One of the best ways to do so is to see what other people want.
That's the goal behind OpenWish - to exchange wishes, needs and ideas.

## How to Get Started 

### Developers

Wan't to help out? Thanks - a helping hand is always needed.
To do so, you can do the following:

1. Improve the [core server](https://github.com/bgnalm/openWish)
2. Improve the the OpenWish client android app (the development hasn't started yet)
3. Create your own OpenWish client (Check the **API Documentation** page)

### Users

For now, the *How It Works* page is the most you can do.
Although when the first client application will be ready, your use will be a crucial part in the success of OpenWish
